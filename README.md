## SONGTRACKER:

Thanks for checking out Songtracker! Songtracker is a simple but useful app that allows you to keep track of your favorite songs, without having to be a subscriber to a streaming platform. Users are able to securely add, edit, and delete songs from their library, and can look up specific songs as well that are stored in their library.

## PLANNING STORY: 

With this app, I was not looking to reinvent the wheel, but to incorporate some of my interests into this project. I kept with a music-focused theme for it as a nod to my love for music. Setting up a server was not as difficult as I anticipated it to be, however I did have to really pace myself to make sure I was doing things correctly during initial setup. I had much more fun with the styling of the client-side, and really wanted to give this app pops of color and a whimsical look.

## Unsolved Problems:

- Include more animation to give the site a more professional feel
